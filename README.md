# 👋 Hello! My name is Oliver

I'm developer that has a frontend focus, but I am a geek too, so like to explore through anything and everything that looks interesting to me. 

### Just some of the things that I have some experience, or a lot of experience in.

# What am I doing?

- 🔎 I am looking for new opportunities to dive into and be apart of. 
- ⚙️ I’m currently working on some personal projects for my portfolio.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be better at TypeScript🤪😭
- 💭 I would like to learn a language like Python or GoLang. I would also like to learn a 3D program, maybe Blender. Adobe After Effects would be pretty cool to learn as well☺️
